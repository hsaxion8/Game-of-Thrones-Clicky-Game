The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. It will also be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.

Heavy use of React and Bootstrap
